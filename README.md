# Trees

## Overview
This project is part of the Ironhack Data Analysis Course (August 2024 - February 2025). In the project, I am analysing a dataset about trees in the Rostock area (Northern Germany). Among others, I will be looking at the following questions:
1. What kind of trees dominate?
2. What are the measurements of the trees?
3. Which trees are more often sponsored?
4. Which kind of trees are more often part of an alley?


## Data 
[Here](https://www.govdata.de/suche/daten/baume), you can take a look at the dataset. For the analysis, I am using the dataset as of 5th December 2024, the exact version can be found in [here]("https://geo.sv.rostock.de/download/opendata/baeume/baeume.csv").
The dataset originally contains 13 columns and 71,139 rows. They are in German but are translated to English during my analysis (only those columns included for the analysis).
